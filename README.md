# ACHCDashboard
The dashboard is a web-based application designed to provide real-time weather information and display data from a Google Sheet CSV file. It is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with AJAX for asynchronous data retrieval.

The user interface of the dashboard is developed using HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing layout. It consists of various sections, such as a weather display area, charts, and a table to showcase the data from the Google Sheet.

To fetch weather data, the dashboard utilizes AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests. It communicates with a weather API by making HTTP requests using JavaScript's XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API. The response from the API is then parsed and displayed on the dashboard, showing details like current temperature, weather conditions, and forecasts.

In addition to weather data, the dashboard also fetches data from a Google Sheet in CSV format. It uses AJAX to retrieve the CSV file from the Google Sheets API. Once the data is received, JavaScript processes it and extracts the relevant information to populate charts or display in a table on the dashboard.

The dashboard's JavaScript code plays a crucial role in handling the data retrieval, processing, and updating the UI accordingly. It manages event listeners, making AJAX requests, parsing responses, and dynamically updating the dashboard with the latest weather information and data from the Google Sheet.
